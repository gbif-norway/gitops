# ðŸ”§ DevOps Request: Fix Prefect Worker Kubernetes Permissions

## **Issue Summary**

The Prefect worker jobs are running with insufficient Kubernetes permissions, causing authentication errors in the logs. While flows are executing successfully, the worker is generating noise in logs due to `system:anonymous` user permissions.

### **Current Error Pattern:**
```
forbidden: User "system:anonymous" cannot get path "/api"
forbidden: User "system:anonymous" cannot get path "/apis"
```

### **Root Cause:**
Prefect worker jobs are being created dynamically but are not using a properly configured ServiceAccount with the necessary RBAC permissions. The jobs are falling back to `system:anonymous` authentication.

## **Solution Overview**

We need to create a dedicated ServiceAccount for Prefect worker jobs with appropriate RBAC permissions, then update the work pool configuration to use this ServiceAccount.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Apply RBAC Configuration**

Apply the provided `prefect-worker-rbac.yaml` file:

```bash
# Update the namespace in the file if needed, then apply
kubectl apply -f prefect-worker-rbac.yaml
```

This creates:
- `prefect-worker` ServiceAccount
- `prefect-worker-role` ClusterRole with comprehensive permissions
- `prefect-worker-binding` ClusterRoleBinding

### **Step 2: Update Work Pool Configuration**

Update your Prefect work pool configuration to use the new ServiceAccount:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "serviceAccountName": "prefect-server"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "serviceAccountName": "prefect-worker"
}
```

### **Step 3: Verify Configuration**

1. Check that the ServiceAccount exists:
   ```bash
   kubectl get serviceaccount prefect-worker -n <namespace>
   ```

2. Verify the ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding:
   ```bash
   kubectl get clusterrole prefect-worker-role
   kubectl get clusterrolebinding prefect-worker-binding
   ```

3. Test with a new flow run to confirm no more authentication errors.

## **Files Modified/Created**

### **New Files:**
- `prefect-worker-rbac.yaml` - RBAC configuration for worker permissions
- `DEVOPS_REQUEST_PREFECT_WORKER_RBAC.md` - This request document

### **Updated Files:**
- `INFRASTRUCTURE_WORK_POOLS.md` - Updated to use `prefect-worker` ServiceAccount

## **RBAC Permissions Included**

The `prefect-worker-role` ClusterRole includes permissions for:

- **Core Resources**: pods, services, configmaps, secrets, events, namespaces
- **Apps Resources**: deployments, statefulsets, daemonsets, replicasets
- **Batch Resources**: jobs, cronjobs
- **Networking**: networkpolicies, ingresses
- **Storage**: persistentvolumeclaims, persistentvolumes
- **RBAC**: roles, rolebindings, clusterroles, clusterrolebindings (read-only)
- **API Discovery**: api, apis (for Kubernetes API discovery)

## **Alternative: Namespace-Scoped Permissions**

If you prefer to limit worker permissions to a specific namespace, the `prefect-worker-rbac.yaml` file includes commented-out Role and RoleBinding configurations that provide namespace-scoped access instead of cluster-wide permissions.

## **Priority & Impact**

- **Priority**: Low (flows are working correctly)
- **Purpose**: Clean up log noise and improve monitoring
- **Risk**: Low (additive changes only)
- **Rollback**: Easy (can revert to `prefect-server` ServiceAccount if needed)

## **Expected Results**

After applying these changes:

1. âœ… No more `system:anonymous` authentication errors in logs
2. âœ… Cleaner, more readable logs
3. âœ… Proper Kubernetes API access for worker jobs
4. âœ… Maintained functionality (flows continue to work)
5. âœ… Better security posture with dedicated worker permissions

## **Testing**

To verify the fix:

1. Apply the RBAC configuration
2. Update work pool configuration
3. Trigger a new flow run
4. Check logs for absence of authentication errors
5. Verify flow execution continues to work normally

## **Monitoring**

After implementation, monitor:

- Log noise reduction
- Flow execution success rates
- Any new permission-related errors
- Worker job creation and cleanup

## **Notes**

- The `prefect-server` ServiceAccount remains unchanged and continues to serve the Prefect server itself
- Worker jobs now have their own dedicated ServiceAccount with appropriate permissions
- This change is backward compatible and can be easily rolled back if needed
- Consider reviewing the permissions periodically to ensure they match your security requirements
